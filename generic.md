My name is Alexia Crawford and my pronouns are she/her. I am currently a junior at the Univesity of Oregon studying computer science with minors in mathematics and sociology.

I am looking for an internship to help me expand my skills and let me work with professionals. I look forward to a collaborative environment where I will learn a lot of new things. 

During the summer of 2024, I worked as a software developer intern for Rhebus Inc. I learned valuable skills in writing test cases, back end engineering, and quality assurance. I worked alongside many professionals who taught me skills both for work, and life. I am very greatful for the opportunity I had and look forward to learning more in my next internship. 

I am currently working as a technology analyst at the University of Oregon tech service desk. I provide  technical support to students, faculty, and staff. My role involves troubleshooting software issues, assisting with network connectivity, and guiding users through various IT services. I specialize in troubleshooting technical problems efficiently and finding clear solutions. Through this role, Iâ€™ve sharpened my problem-solving skills, deepened my understanding of IT systems, and developed strong customer service expertise.

Feel free to contact me through the form on the bottom of the page and I will get back to you as soon as possible!
